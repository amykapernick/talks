					<p class="title">The Art of Failure</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						We're not strangers to failure, but why does that have to be a bad thing? 

						Failure is important and it's a chance for us to learn.
						
						But most of you don't know me, and I don't expect you to just believe what I'm saying, so let me start at the beginning

						After high school, I moved to Perth to study Mechanical Engineering.

						In Semester 1, I failed Mechanics
						
						In Semester 2, I failed Maths
						
						In Semester 3, I failed Graphics and Strength of Materials
						
						In Semester 4, I failed Thermodynamics and Mechanical Design
						
						Can anyone guess what happened next?
						
						In Semester 5, I learnt something really important

						So what am I doing now?

						After Engineering, I worked in IT Support at Curtin, working in and then managing a team of support officers and doing a little freelance web development on the side
						
						Then last year I decided to take the leap and started applying to work as a web developer full time

						This year, I've started rock climbing on a regular basis.

						I've found it's a great way to un-wind at the end of the week
						
						It's a great way to exercise
						
						And the feeling when you finally manage to get a tough move or finish a new wall is amazing.
						
						When I started planning this talk, I instantly thought of when I go rock climbing.

					<aside class="notes">
						When you're climbing, there are often times when you need to jump for a hold.

						And sometimes you miss and fall back in the harness.
						
						And that's ok.
						
						It gives you an opportunity to sit back in the harness, and take a look back.
						
						You can learn from it

						When I decided I wanted to work in the web fulltime, I did this.

						I took a chance
						
						Since then, I worked at an agency in Subiaco, and got to work on the web all day, every day
						
						I decided to get more involved in the community and started helping as an organiser for Fenders
						
						The community gave me a chance to learn. And learn and learn.
						
						I love working in web development. I love learning new things, I love discovering new technologies and techniques and in the web industry, there will always be something new
						
						I've continued working as a freelancer on the side, I found it's a great chance to try out new things away from the restrictions of browser support and clients and agency life.

					<p class="title">Failure</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure. Say it to yourself.

						The word seems to have so many negative connotations, it just sounds bad.
						
						We need to change the way we look at failure, the way we address it, the way we use the word failure.
						
						And honestly, do we even trust success?
						
						How many times have you run a test or compiled your code, gotten no errors and completely trusted it?
						
						Over the weekend I migrated a website from my old hosting to my new one.
						
						Nothing too fancy, just a simple Wordpress build but when I finished the migration and the website worked I was still skeptical.
						
						Experience has taught me that sometimes you just can't trust it when things seem to work.
						
						As it was, something had gone horribly wrong (which may have also been related to the fact that I upgraded my php version to 7.2 around the same time), and the admin console was completely broken.
						
						My simple Wordpress migration ended up taking me a week, and the site was actually offline for a few hours, and had a temporary landing page for 2 days.
						
						To start, I'm going to give you a couple of examples of my professional experiences of failure
					</aside>

					Frustrated computer user
					<aside class="notes">
						In my last job, I broke the dev server, has anyone else here done that?

						Well I broke the dev server on my second day
						
						Needless to say, I was freaking out
						
						It was only day 2 and I'd already taken an entire server offline
						
						But as I found out, we didn't have failure...
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					Doughnuts
					<aside class="notes">
						We had doughnuts.

						If you did something wrong, like:
						- not follow a document
						- email the wrong client
						- not lock the office properly
						- break a server
						
						that was a 'doughnutable' offense
						
						This was good because it meant that you weren't afraid of doing the wrong thing and had a chance to learn
						
						There was still a disincentive (have you ever had to buy Krispy Kremes for 11 people?) but you were able to learn and give things a go without fear of losing your job or getting into trouble
						
						Ignoring the fact that we had 3 diabetics in the office, I saw this and thought it was a pretty good approach to 'failures'
					</aside>

				<section>
					Phones
					<aside class="notes">
						When I worked at Curtin, we received funding to run a 24 hour student helpdesk. 

						This was an idea that continued to get floated, and we already knew that we didn't need this, but another department was funding it and insisted we give it a go.
						
						4 weeks later, we'd received 2 phone calls to the helpdesk. I guess you could call it a failure
						
						But it was a 'good failure'. Now we had physical proof that a 24 hour helpdesk wasn't worth it.
						
						We learnt from it
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p class="title">Embrace Failure</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure can be a good thing, and it's not something that we should always avoid.

						Failure usually means that we've stepped outside of our comfort zones and done something new.
						
						Tonight I'm embracing failure in many ways. 
						
						While I've done a lot of public speaking before, tonight is my first time speaking at a meetup.
						
						And as with most new situations, I'm aware that I might fail and embracing it
						
						Thankfully though, I've known that even if I failed tonight, I'd just use it as a working example *pause for laughter*
						
						I even had the chance to learn how to animate for my rock climbing animation before (although as you could tell, I didn't get the chance to learn to draw)
						
						If we don't open ourselves up to failure, we miss the opportunity to try something new
					</aside>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						While we can change the way we look at failure, it often still hurts when it happens.

						A month ago, I got made redundant. 
						
						It's hard to not think of that as a failure, and there are a lot of things that help make it easier.

				<section>
					<p class="title">People</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						People are important.

						Community is important.
						
						Over the past year, I've gone through many ups and downs. Some personal, some professional.
						
						But through it all, I had people.
						
						If I had a personal down, I had my friends and family
						
						If I had a professional down, I had Fenders
						
						Perth is blessed with a metric fuck-tonne number of community groups and I highly recommend joining one (or all) of them
						
						There's always someone who's been through a similar situation to you, and everyone else just offers support
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class="title">Learn</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is something that's always important and I believe especially so when you're a junior dev

						This means learning from your mistakes and failures
						
						But this is also important to prepare for failure
						
						I take every opportunity I have to learn something new or to try something different
						
						I'd even been learning React in my spare time (there's not much of it)
						
						This meant that when I was looking for a new job, I'd learnt new skills outside of my existing role
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					D&D Game
					<aside class="notes">
						Learning doesn't just mean reading tutorials or doing something constructive.

						DO SOMETHING FUN!
						
						When I was first looking for roles in the web, I completed several courses on Codecademy and from one of them I got an idea
						
						I created this game, based on the course and our D&D game, and continued to expand on it
						
						It meant that I had something else to showcase my skills, and the novelty appeared to a lot of people.
						
						One interviewer admitted he'd spent 20 minutes playing it
						
						So do something different, something that interests you
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class="title">You</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is the most important part.

						Apologies for going a little off-topic, but this is really important
						
						Sometimes you have a really important project that you need to get done, or just want to put another hour in before you leave work
						
						As a junior dev, I found I was more tempted to do this because I wanted to prove that I was a good dev and a hard worker
						
						Make sure you're looking after yourself first, otherwise you risk the failure hitting you harder
						
						I've burnt out before, and I've learnt to recognise the signs and take time out early.
						
						(Shamless self promotion) Fenders is trying to raise awareness and acceptance of mental health importance nad burnout and ran several events for Geek Mental Help Week in October. Keep an eye out for more events
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure is a fact of life and very important for learning

						There is nothing wrong with not getting it right the first time
						
						Take the time to sit back and learn from the experience
						
						And don't be afraid to jump for it again (but you know, if you broke dev, maybe don't do the exact same thing again)
						
						And even more importantly, take the time away from work
						
						Spend time in the community and with friends
						
						And look after yourself, don't be afraid to ask for help or take a break when you need it
						
						But don't be afraid of failure. It may become a funny story one day, or at the very least a funny gif
