						We're not strangers to failure, but why does that have to be a bad thing?<br />
						Failure is important and it's a chance for us to learn.<br />
						To start off, I'm going to take you back to the beginning where this all began<br />

						I grew up in a small town in rural Queensland and after high school I moved to Perth to study Engineering<br />

						This year, I've started rock climbing on a regular basis.<br />
						I've found it's a great way to un-wind at the end of the week<br />
						It's a great way to exercise<br />
						And the feeling when you finally manage to get a tough move or finish a new wall is amazing.<br />
						When I started planning this talk, I instantly thought of when I go rock climbing.<br />

						When you're climbing, there are often times when you need to jump for a hold.<br />
						And sometimes you miss and fall back in the harness.<br />
						And that's ok.<br />
						It gives you an opportunity to sit back in the harness, and take a look back.<br />
						You can learn from it<br />

						I decided to get more involved in the community and started helping as an organiser for Fenders<br />
						The community gave me a chance to learn and I met a whole group of people who did what I do<br />
						I love working in web development. I love learning new things, I love discovering new technologies and techniques and in the web industry, there will always be something new<br />

						While working at the agency, I continued working as a freelancer on the side as I found it was a great chance to try out new things away from the restrictions of browser support, clients and agency life<br />

						In the past year, I've got to work with a heap of amazing people on a bunch of cool projects, and learnt a lot of really important skills, both in development and in life<br />
						And I've still been able to pay my bills so I'm going to count this as not a failure (yet)<br />

					<p class="title">Learn</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Learning is important no matter where you are in your career, whether you're a junior, intermediate, senior or even the CTO<br/>
						This means learning from your mistakes and failures<br/>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/alert.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Although I use git, I use it more for continuous deployment and sharing code when I'm doing subcontracting so I'm not great at my commits and most of them are something like "did stuff" or "it's fixed now"<br/>
						That was at least until earlier this year when out of the blue my computer died on me. It crashed and then refused to boot and I had to reset the whole thing several times. Of course this was 2 hours before a meeting with a client and I lost everything.<br/>
						Thankfully the client was also a developer so understood my pain, but I'm much better at pushing my code at regular intervals now, although my git commit messages could still use some work.<br/>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						But learning is also important to prepare for failure<br/>
						I take every opportunity I have to learn something new or to try something different<br/>
						Last year I started learning React in my spare time<br/>
						This meant that when I had to look for a new job, I'd learnt new skills outside of my existing role<br/>
						These new skills (although they were very basic) even got me some contracting work when I needed it most, and led to a an ongoing relatinship contracting for a startup<br/>

					<img src="./img/dragon.gif" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Learning doesn't just mean reading tutorials or doing something constructive.<br />
						DO SOMETHING FUN!<br />
						When I was first looking for roles in the web, I completed several courses on Codecademy and from one of them I got an idea<br />
						I created this game, based on the course and our D&D game, and continued to expand on it<br />
						It meant that I had something else to showcase my skills, and the novelty appeared to a lot of people.<br />
						One interviewer admitted he'd spent 20 minutes playing it<br />
						So do something different, something that interests you<br />

				<section>

					<aside class="notes">
						Learning doesn't have to mean doing a side project or using up all your free time either.<br />
						Listen to podcasts or read blog posts on your commute, watch conference talks or attend meetups.<br />
						Don't feel like you need to spend all your spare time doing countless side projects, we all have lives and people we want to see (well sometimes we want to see them)<br />
						There are a bunch of different resources out there, I really enjoy the podcast SyntaxFm, they not only talk about new tech but non technical skills including how to learn<br />

					<p class="title">Failure</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure. Say it to yourself.<br />
						The word seems to have so many negative connotations, it just sounds bad.<br />
						We need to change the way we look at failure, the way we address it, the way we use the word failure.<br />

					<p class="title">So Failure is Good?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						The topic of failure is starting to come up more and more often, and people are starting to see it as a good thing and to talk about it with others<br />

						And because I know that anyone who hasn't heard of these before is wondering now...<br/>
						Fuck up nights is a community with events all over the world where you can get together and share/hear stories of professional fuck ups. <br/>
						Whether it's a business crashing and burning or a product being recalled, they're helping to remove the stigma behind failing or admitting to failing.<br/>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fuck.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						I also like the point they make in "The Subtle Art of Giving a Fuck" which talks about the difference between fault and responsibility<br />
						When you've failed, it may not necessarily be your fault, but what you do with it is your responsibility. <br />

				<section>
					<img src="./img/death.png" />
					<aside class="notes">
						When I think of failure, I think of Terry Pratchett's satirical personification of death in the Discworld books<br/>
						A quirky character and one of my favourite characters, Death helps the characters he encounters come to terms (as they usually aren't thrilled to see him most of the time), has a fondness for cats, a horse called Binky and at one point even calls it quits and becomes a fry cook for a short period.<br/>
						To me, failure is somewhere between a friend and an acquaintance.<br/>
						I never make plans to meet up, but when I end up running into them on the street it's nice to catch up<br/>

				<section>
					<p>Failure isn't one size fits all</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						There are so many different types of failures and they all affect everyone differently.<br/>
						Failure may be<br/>
						- A mistake at work<br/>
						- Losing a job<br/>
						- Personal failures like losing a relationship<br/>
						- Study relationship (the one that actually comes with an F)<br/>
						I've experienced all of these failures and they all hit differently<br/>
						In the same way there's a huge difference between making a mistake at work, and losing a relationship, they won't feel the same<br/>
						And it's not even different types of failures, there's a huge difference between losing a job you've had for 3 months and a job you've been in for 30 years they'll both affect you differently<br/>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						When I got made redundant last year, I wasn't in a good place at work and I was actually looking for a different job<br/>
						I was stressed, I wasn't sleeping, I'd spent the 2 months previous working 60-70 hours each week and it eventually it got to the point where my doctor got me to take a week off work because I was getting dizzy and nauseous. <br/>
						When I got asked to come into the office even though I was sick, I expected the worst, I thought I was going to get fired, so the redundancy almost came as a relief<br/>
						But even though it was a good thing, and I'm glad it happened, it still hit me a little (although not as hard as it could have been)<br/>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>It's ok to not be ok</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						While it's important to move on from failure, it's also important to let yourself feel it first<br />
						When I got made redundant, I called my mum, I cried in my car and then I met a friend for coffee. I let myself feel it.<br />
						Then I went home and started applying for jobs.<br />
						Failures can be big or small and it's ok to feel it, it's ok to not be ok.<br />
						Take a break, take your time, use your support system and don't feel like you have to be fine with it or put on a brave face all the time<br />
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p class="title">You</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is the most important part.<br />
						Sometimes you have a really important project that you need to get done, or just want to put another hour in before you leave work<br />
						When I was starting out, I found I was more tempted to do this because I wanted to prove that I was a good dev and a hard worker, and I'm still often tempted to do this when I'm working for myself	<br />
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/lake_dog.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Make sure you're looking after yourself first, otherwise you risk the failure hitting you harder<br />
						I've burnt out before, and I've learnt to recognise the signs and take time out early.<br />
						Mental health week was earlier this month and there were events run in the tech community all over Australia. While there's still a way to go, more and more companies and communities are starting to realise the importance and remove the stigma around mental health, burnout and work life balance.<br />

				<section>
					<p class="title">People</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						People are important.<br />
						Community is important.<br />
						Over the past year, I've gone through many ups and downs. Some personal, some professional.<br />
						But through it all, I had people.<br />
						If I had a personal down, I had my friends and family<br />
						If I had a professional down, I had Fenders<br />

				<section>
					<img src="./img/community.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						Melbourne is blessed with a metric fuck-tonne number of community groups and I highly recommend joining one (or all) of them<br />
						There's always someone who's been through a similar situation to you, and everyone else just offers support<br />
						Make sure you check out some amazing meetups like Junior Dev Melbourne or Google Developer Group. And definitely make sure you check out Fenders if you're ever in Perth<br />

					<aside class="notes">
						In my last job, I broke the dev server, has anyone else here done that?<br />
						Well I broke the dev server on my second day<br />
						Needless to say, I was freaking out<br />
						It was only day 2 and I'd already taken an entire server offline<br />
						But as I found out, we didn't have failure...<br />

					<img class="background" src="./img/doughnuts.jpg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						We had doughnuts.<br />
						If you did something wrong, like:<br />
						- not follow a document<br />
						- email the wrong client<br />
						- not lock the office properly<br />
						- break a server<br />
						that was a 'doughnutable' offense<br />
						This was good because it meant that you weren't afraid of doing the wrong thing and had a chance to learn<br />
						There was still a disincentive (have you ever had to buy Krispy Kremes for 11 people?) but you were able to learn and give things a go without fear of losing your job or getting into trouble<br />
						Ignoring the fact that we had 3 diabetics in the office, I saw this and thought it was a pretty good approach to 'failures'<br />

				<section>
					<p>Support your Team</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Make sure you're supporting your team with their failures<br />
						It's easy to start finger pointing, especially when using things like git blame, so make sure you're not starting a witch hunt when people fail at work<br />
						Encourage your team so they're not afraid of failing at work, and if everyone's failing occasionally you might even find you've got less finger pointing going on<br />

					<p>Embrace Failure</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure can be a good thing, and it's not something that we should always avoid.<br />
						Failure usually means that we've stepped outside of our comfort zones and done something new.<br />
						This talk is one of my favourite examples of embracing failure<br />
						Last year I gave my first talk at a meetup, they'd themed the night "Failure" and I wrote this talk<br />

					<img src="./img/juniordev_speaking.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						While I'd done a lot of public speaking before, it was my first time speaking at a meetup and it was my first time giving a presentation of my own<br />
						And today I'm here giving my first conference talk<br />
						And as with most new situations, I'm aware that I might fail and embracing it<br />
						Thankfully though, I've known that if I fail today I can just use it as a working example of how it's ok to fail pause for laughter<br />
						If we don't open ourselves up to failure, we miss the opportunity to try something new<br />
					</aside>

				<section>
					<aside class="notes">
						Failure is a fact of life and very important for learning<br />
						There is nothing wrong with not getting it right the first time<br />
						Take the time to sit back and learn from the experience<br />
						And don't be afraid to jump for it again (but you know, if you broke dev, maybe don't do the exact same thing again)<br />
						And even more importantly, take the time away from work<br />
						Spend time in the community and with friends<br />
						And look after yourself, don't be afraid to ask for help or take a break when you need it<br />
