Similarly to how we can use ESLint for
JavaScript linting we can also use a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.009
different tool called stylelint for
linting our styles, like CSS and Sass.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.640
So I'm going to create a new
file stylelint.rc which is a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.960
specific config file for this.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:31.495
And similar to in the ESLint config file,
we have extends, we also have processers.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:35.148
We can use processors, which allow
us to specify additional plugins to

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:35.345
hook into the stylelint pipeline,
but we're not doing that today.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:44.745
rather than extending a existing
config in here I have specified a

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:49.995
bunch of different rules for different
conditions that style can check for

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:52.035
and what I want it to test again.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.480
Now similar to ESLint, I can test
this in the command line or I can

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.390
also use an extension in VS Code to
automatically check against my files.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:15.640
So if I open up one of my sass files, And
say, for example, I go through and add

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
a couple of extra spaces because I know
that there's config that says I can only

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.670
have one empty line between sections.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.630
I open up my terminal and see the
output at the bottom, it is giving me an

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.060
error "expected no more than one empty
line" which is one of the config rules.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.610
There we go.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.900
And if I remove that, that has
now gotten rid of the problems.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.060
And so that will continue to go
through and check against my stylelint

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.030
file as I write my code and we'll
do it automatically, rather than me

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.560
having to run the tests manually.
