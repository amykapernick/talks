00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:13.580
So the first thing we do is create
an ESLint config file eslint.rc.js

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.120
that's cause it's a JavaScript file.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.985
And inside of that, we're going to
set our exports for the config and

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:30.960
inside of that, we're going to set
three different properties we're going

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.220
to set extends, this allows us to
extend and expand on existing config

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.690
that we may import from elsewhere.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.190
Plugins this allows us to install
plugins and add extra functionality

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.069
and rule, these allow us to
specify specific individual rules

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.379
that we want this to follow.

00:00:52.534 --> 00:01:00.964
first inside of the ESLint extends, I want
to extend out the Airbnb ESLint config.

00:01:01.324 --> 00:01:04.524
This is a really good starting point
if you don't really know what you want

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:08.124
to sort out, you can work from the rs.

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:12.224
I don't have any plugins that
I want to use, but I do want

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:14.324
to specify some other rules.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:20.234
These  are rules that either Airbnb hasn't
specified for, or I don't like the way

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:24.404
that they've done things so I can go
through it and specifically set rules

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:26.534
that I want to be setting in my config.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:32.239
the next thing I want to do is I
want to go through and run this

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.769
from the command line in my project.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:38.899
So I'm going to go npm run test:eslint
which is a command I've already set

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.199
up to go through and to run ESLint.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:47.515
I want it to output the results to
a file and I want it to format it as

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:54.805
JSON and as I expected, it has got a
bunch of errors and this has failed.

00:01:55.345 --> 00:02:02.515
And so if I have a look inside my tests
folder is an eslint.json file This has

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:11.104
now gone through and given me a bunch of
errors, for when things aren't the way

00:02:11.134 --> 00:02:13.474
that I want it to be with the config.

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:17.164
So I can go through and
have a look at these here.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:25.899
for example, here I can see inside
of my ESLint config file the rule for

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.999
no mixed spaces and tabs, on line 27.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.499
So line 27, there.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.609
So I can go through and fix that there.
