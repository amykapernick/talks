As with the other test suites, I can then
go through and test a different page or

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.710
different specific sections of a page.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
Now I can create a new test file
to do this, or I can describe a new

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.090
test further down inside my file.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.130
And for example, here I can go through
and I'm going to create a new test

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.330
for my mobile blog post template.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.670
Inside this test, one of the first
things I want to do as well as visit

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:38.825
one of my blog posts, which is the
HTML and CSS Tricks post that we tested

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:46.595
before, I also want to set the specific
viewport to be Samsung S10 device size.

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.905
Now there are various different options
here, you can specify width and height

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:54.545
but in this case, I want to set a
specific device that I'm testing against.

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:58.265
Now, after that, I want to go
through and I want to make sure

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:00.274
that the post title is visible.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.179
So I want to make sure that
the h1 is visible on the page

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.830
in the mobile viewport size.

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:10.880
And then I want to make sure that
you can click on the site title

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.240
to navigate back to my home page.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.310
Just want to make sure that
you can click on that there.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.690
So if I open up my test suite
again, I can then go through and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.899
we'll go through and it will run my
homepage tests from before again.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.590
It will then go through and test.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.005
And it says that it does have a
visible page title, so it's able

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.595
to see that here that's visible.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:59.134
So it does have a visible
post title, but it's unable to

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:02.765
find my .site-title element.

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:09.535
So my HTML has changed and it's
unable to find this element.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:17.515
So I can then go through and have a look
here inside of my header file, I can

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:23.304
have a look and I don't have a class of
"site-title" on this link here, so I can

00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:27.135
add that there, site-title, save that.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:32.504
I can then go through
and run my test again.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:42.494
And this time it wll go through and run
all the tests and this time it should be

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.294
able to navigate back to the homepage.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:50.169
So get .site-title, which it has,
and it's able to click on that

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.999
and it goes back to the homepage.

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.869
So the tests have all passed now.
