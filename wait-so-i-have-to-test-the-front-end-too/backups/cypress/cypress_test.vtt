If we want to create our own tests,
we can go through and create test

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
files inside of the Cypress folder,
inside of the integration folder and

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.840
create a new file called test.js.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:24.389
Now Cypress uses JavaScript files and the
syntax may be similar, but they have a lot

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:32.870
of their own stuff as part of these tests,
I can start off by creating my test.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.180
When we're writing our tests with
Cypress, if you're not familiar with

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.234
Cypress or other test suites, the
syntax and the language may be a

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:47.344
little bit foreign to you at first,
but it gets easier as we go along.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:52.294
So Cypress bundles together, Mocha,
Chai, and jQuery to build its tests.

00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:56.674
And we start off by describing
our tests that we're writing.

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:59.074
Now, this is a description for people.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:03.034
So this is where we're looking
to make something easy for people

00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:06.065
to read and understand what it
is that we're looking at here.

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:12.005
Then we are going to go through
and describe an action that we

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.935
want Cypress to do before the test,
for example, to visit our webpage.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:18.755
So we want it to visit
our localhost web page.

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:23.525
Then we're going to start to go through
and start to describe our actions

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.234
and the tests that we're checking.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:29.644
So, first of all, we're going to go
through and check that it contains

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.514
"My Testing Blog" in the title.

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:38.394
So the meta title of the page should
contain the phrase "My Testing Blog".

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:42.634
Inside of that, we're going to create
the function for the test to let

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:46.954
Cypress know what we're testing and
here we're using cy.title, so the

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:54.500
title that Cypress gets back should
contain "My Testing Blog", this is the

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.070
assertion that we're testing against.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.160
it should contain the
phrase, "My Testing Blog.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:06.150
Similarly, we can then go through
and check if the blog page

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:08.870
contain posts in the blog feed?

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.670
Now here we can use, similar to jQuery
fetching CSS, selectors we can get the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.280
".feed" element, and inside of that,
we want to find an article element.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.120
So I want to make sure there's at least
one article element inside of the feed.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.170
Next I want to make sure that
each of the posts contain a title.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.200
So it's going to go through and get
every HTML article element and inside

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.839
of that article element, I want it
to then fetch a h2, which is what I'm

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.029
using for the title of each article.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:51.769
I then wan it to check that
I can access my blog posts by

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.509
clicking on the article title.

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.919
I'm just going to test
the first one this time.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.769
Going to go through
and get "article h2 a".

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.910
So inside of an article, we want a h2,
and inside of that, we want an anchor tag.

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.780
I'm just going to get the first
one, because it will give me

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.190
a list of multiple elements.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.280
I want to get the first one and I
want to click on it and make sure

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.410
that will go through to another page.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.720
So now if I open up my Cypress
test suite, again, we can see, we

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.640
now have the test.js file here.

00:03:28.534 --> 00:03:33.064
If I click on that, that will then go
through and it will run it in the browser.

00:03:34.144 --> 00:03:37.264
So we can see here, it's
jumping through the tests.

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:45.514
First check contains "My Testing Blog" in
the title and it's expected and it does.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:46.954
So that's all good.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:55.004
Then it checks that it contains posts
inside of the blog feed.,there's

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:59.314
the feed and there are the
articles, so that's all good.

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:03.094
Then it checks that each
post contains a title.

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:10.544
So each of the article h2, each of them
has a title and then it checks if you can

00:04:10.594 --> 00:04:13.414
access the posts via the article title?

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:18.934
So we go through and we get the
articles, the links inside of

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:20.914
the articles, get the first one.

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:27.769
So that's just the first blog
post here, and then click on it.

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:33.109
And when that's clicked on it, that's
then gone through to the blog posts and

00:04:33.109 --> 00:04:34.699
that has access to the new page here.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.049
So we can then go through it and we can
click through and we can have a look

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:47.239
and see where each of the tests are at
and what elements it's found in them.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:50.549
So we can see all of
those tests have passed.
