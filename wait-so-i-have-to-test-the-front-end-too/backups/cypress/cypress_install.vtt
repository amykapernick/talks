This file was generated by Descript <www.descript.com>

00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:12.129
similar to backstop, the first time
we run Cyprus, it will go through and

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.259
create a bunch of files for us and
initialize inside of our project so that

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.060
we have something to get started with.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.101
Now we can see here while that's loading.

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:28.271
We can see this has created a cypress.json
file inside of our project folder.

00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:33.321
And it has also created a Cypress folder,
which includes a bunch of different

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:39.591
files, including a folder where we can
put plugins and an integration folder,

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:44.631
which already includes a bunch of
example, tests for us to start with.

00:00:46.555 --> 00:00:51.615
Now, depending on your setup, you
may get some errors in the terminal

00:00:51.645 --> 00:01:00.075
similar to this, but you should also
have a popup open up on your computer.

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:07.725
This is the testing window that
we'll be running Cyprus tests in.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.495
inside of this, we can see
here, the examples folder.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.185
So this is the example tests
that have already been created.

00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:17.985
We can go through and have a look
at all of the files that they've

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:21.075
created already to go for us.

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:22.275
If we click on one of them.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.290
It will then go through and
it will run in the test suite.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.190
We'll go through and run the tests
that have been previously set up,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.260
which they're running it against
the example Cypress website.
