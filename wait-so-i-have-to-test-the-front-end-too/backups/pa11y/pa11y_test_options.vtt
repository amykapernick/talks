Now if we, and some options inside
of our pa11y test, Like for example,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.380
we can change the particular WCAG
standard that we're testing against,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.460
so by default it tests against AA, but
we might want to test it against AAA.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.199
We can also go through and set it
to save a screen capture of the

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.379
site when it runs a test against it.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.950
Now this can be really useful because
we're using a headless browser.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.570
Sometimes what it loads may be
different to what we see in our browser.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.140
So this can be super useful to work
out if we, if you're confused by why

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.580
we're getting a particular error.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.870
So if I go through and set that
up and run my test again, I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.829
can, when the test finishes.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.690
I can then have a look and again, we've
got a bunch of different errors, we've

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.740
got even more areas this time because
we're testing against the much higher

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:27.080
accessibility standard, but I can also say
this has taken a screenshot of my blog so

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.570
I can see exactly what it's seeing when
it loads it inside the headless browser.
