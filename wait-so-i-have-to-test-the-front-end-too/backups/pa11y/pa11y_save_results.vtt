Once we've created our pa11y test file.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.860
We can go through and run
our test in the console.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.990
So within of the project, I'm going
to run the command npm run test:pa11y,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.130
which I've set up for this use case.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.680
Now this will go through and run it
to Pally, uses puppeteer as a headless

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.889
browser to load the webpage and to then
test it against the standard config.

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:34.800
Once that test has been run, we can see
here, it has then printed out a little

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.269
bit of information about the page.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.810
So I know what it's looking at and a array
of issues, which is be a bunch of objects,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.330
which I'm unable to read in the console.

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:52.045
So next to make it a little bit
easier to actually see the results

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:58.915
I'm going to go through and
import the file-system package.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:09.465
Which is a package that was
available for NodeJS to allow us

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:15.075
to save files to our computer so we
can actually see what's going on.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:21.375
So I'm going to require the
file-system package then instead of

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:29.180
logging the results to the console,
I'm going to use the file-system

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.350
package to write to a file.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.680
So inside of the test folder, I want
to create another results folder

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.660
and create a file called pa11y.json,
I'm going to stringify the results

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.990
that I get back from my test and
log out any errors if I get them.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.765
So now, rather than logging the results to
the console I want to save that to a file.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:58.135
Now, if I go through and run my tests
again, and instead of the results

00:01:58.135 --> 00:02:03.685
being logged out to the console, it
should then create a file, which I

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:05.365
can see, that's created a file here.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:09.245
If I look in results/pa11y.json.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.590
And this has then given me a nice lng
file with a bunch of accessibility

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.500
issues that I have on my site
