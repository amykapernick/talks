00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.760
So, if we want to add and run additional
tests, we can go through and add them

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.670
further down inside of our promise.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.640
Say, for example, we want to run our
homepage against specifically a mobile

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.620
screen size and a desktop screen size.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:31.700
We can then change our first test to
test against a post and I can find

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.679
a blog post, a particular URL of one
of the book posts that I know I have.

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.169
And I can then go through and
test specifically a blog post, the

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.860
homepage of my blog at a mobile
screen size and the home page of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.779
my blog at a desktop screen size.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.629
Now, if I go through and run these
tests, we should go through and test the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.080
three different pages at the specific
screen size that I've specified.

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:19.005
Now I can see, I have a bunch more
screenshots that have been taken.

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:28.694
I can see the different blog posts
and, the mobile size and if I

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:39.789
open up my results file I can see
inside of my results array I now

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.069
have three separate items, one for
each page that have tested against.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.339
This is my blog posts that I've
tested against, this was the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.739
main blog page at mobile size and
then this was it at desktop size.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.929
So it's gone through and run
the tests against the three

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.239
different pages that I set.
