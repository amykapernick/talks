Now to create a Pa11y test to use in my
project, I'm going to create a file for

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:15.430
it inside of my test folder, I'm going to
create a new file called pa11y.js, Because

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.190
we write the pa11y tests in JavaScript.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.270
Now, inside of this file, I'm going
to say set up a basic pa11y test,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.059
and inside of this, first of all,
going to require the pa11y package.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.139
Which I've already installed.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.719
I'm then going to create
a function to run my test.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:43.299
Now this needs to be an async function so
that we get the results back and inside

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.799
of that, I'm going to create a promise
inside of the promise I want to run the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:54.219
pa11y function and for now I'm just going
to pass in the URL of our website that

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.279
we're testing, which is localhost:8080.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.930
Then at the end I'm going to log
out the results to my consult and

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.739
at the end of the file, I want to
click to run the test so I can go

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.650
through and run that in my console.
