	Why test?
	<Notes slot="notes">
		- First off, I'm not going to delve into why we need to be testing or why we need to test the front end of our applications
		- If you're here or watching this at home, I'm going to assume that you know we need to test
		- If you don't know why, or aren't convinced yet, I've got another talk for you

		- In 2020 I gave a talk about the whys and hows of front end Testing
		- I did give it in London, but this will take you to the Sydney version which is a bit more updated
		- Now that we're all on the same page on why we need to test, lets have a look at how we can go about running these tests

	Why GitHub Actions?
	<Notes slot="notes">
		- So why GitHub actions you ask? This is a great question that I want to address in 2 parts
	</Notes>
</Slide>

<Slide>
	Manual tests are ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
	<Notes slot="notes">
		- While definitely better than nothing, manual tests aren't great because it's hard to ensure that they're being run
		- How many of your enjoy doing a repetitive task that could easily be automated?
	</Notes>
</Slide>

<Slide>
	Automation adds consistency
	<Notes slot="notes">
		- When tests are automated, as part of any kind of process, it means it's going to happen
		- It adds a check to make sure that we're 
	</Notes>
</Slide>

<Slide>
	Why GitHub Actions?
	<Notes slot="notes">
		- But why did I choose GitHub actions to use for running tests and as my CI/CD tool?
		- The documentation and assistance available to me was good and meant it wasn't hard to get started
		- It's also compatible with a lot of existing things I was going to want to do
		- And has great extensibility so works for smaller personal projects and bigger enterprise projects
	</Notes>

	<Notes slot="notes">
		- It's a very powerful tool that I could also do a whole talk on
		- So if you want to look into it a bit more, check outn the GitHub docs or there are a few people from GitHub here this week so see if you can track on of them down

	<Notes slot="notes">
		- GitHub Actions runs what are called *workflows*, which are written inside *workflow files* inside a particular folder of your project
		- As with a lot of devops tools, these files are written in yaml

		1. Name of the Workflow
		2. How the workflow is triggered, in this case every time a pull request to the prod branch gets opened, reopened or the code in the PR gets updated
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
		3. The jobs/tasks that the workflow completes, by default these will all run at the same time
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow
		4. Each job gets a different name, eg. `build`, but the name must be unique
		5. Set the platform that the job will run on, you can choose a number of different options, but running on Linux is the cheapest option
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job
		6. Each job has a number of steps to complete (these will complete one after another), most of the time your first step will be to checkout the repo code, otherwise you won't have anything to work with

		1. Here we'll set the command to run, this is using the Netlify CLI using the deploy command. We'll pass in the environment variables for the site and auth token, and have set the output to come through as JSON
			- https://cli.netlify.com/commands/deploy
		2. Next we'll run the command, and save the output in another variable so we can access it
		3. To parse the output from Netlify, the jq package allows us to fetch the different properties and save them as individual variables.
			- https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
		4. Lastly we'll save the Netlify preview URL as an output parameter for the workflow step, so we can access it in future steps, eg. to add it as a comment on our PR

	<Notes slot="notes">
		1. If we add an ID to our step, it can be referred to elsewhere in our workflow, this ID must be unique
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsid
		2. For this step we also need to use some environment variables, which we're pulling in from GitHub Secrets
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv
		3. This step will run a command in the terminal, which runs a custom script we'll create to build and deploy the site

		1. Because the testing job is different, we need to out the Netlify URL so we can access it in another job
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idoutputs
		2. Creating a new job for the tests to run in
		3. Because the website has to have built first, we're defining a dependency on the `needs` property, that the test job needs to have the build job complete first
			- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idneeds
		4. Jobs run in their own separate environments, so we need to checkout the repo code again so we can run tests that are defined in the repo
