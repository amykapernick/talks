		<Notes slot="notes">
			- All of us here today are in a very important position, one to make a difference to people around us

		<span class="fragment">Inclusion makes us <Switch words={['more-effective', 'more innovative', 'better', 'happier']} /></span>

		<Notes slot="notes">
			- But let's just for a second ignore that we shouldn't be excluding people
			- What else does accessibility and inclusion do for us?
			- A study in 2018 by the Disability Council of Australia and Suncorp found that inclusive teams and workplaces where
				- 10 times more likely to be highly effective
				- 9 x innovative
				- 4 x provide excellent customer service
				- 4 x to stay at a company
				- 19 x more satisfied with their jobs

	<Slide>
		Accessibility is a human right
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We're seeing drastic changes to legislation and regulations around the accessibility and Inclusion
			- Ccuntries all over are ensuring their laws are up to date as technology becomes more intermingled with our day-to-day
			- Not a case of if, but when we're going to be legally required to make sure what we build is accessible
			- And the secret is...
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		It's easier to do it right now
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- It's easier it make changes and improvements now, as we build things
			- To include it from the very beginning, rather than trying to stick a band aid on it later
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="quote">
		<blockquote>
			<p>Every inaccessible website tells [people with an impairment] *"you aren't welcome in this world"*.</p>
			<p>If you don't know whether your website or app is accessible, it's not. Start learning.</p>
			<cite>Larene Le Gassick</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- If you don't know whether you're doing it right, you're probably not

	<Slide type="background" image={Impairments} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- When we think of accessibility, we think of people with permanent impairments

		<Notes slot="notes">
			- The world bank estimates that these people, people with permanent impairments are at least 15% of the global population
			- That's over 1.2 billion people
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={Impairments} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Again these are what we refer to as permanent impairments
			- Which are just a small subset of people with impairments
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={ImpairmentTypes} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Permanent impairments are not likely to be resolved, are long term, like a missing or non functioning limb
			- There are also temporary impairments, which can't be resolved quickly but will resolve in the short to long term, for example a broken arm
			- And finally we have situational impairments which are the result of the environment alone and can be resolved by leaving it, for example holding a child or pet
			- Although not all impairments are permanent, and may not have as great an impact on a person's life, they can all be made easier by accessibility improvements we make
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={ImpairmentCategories} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Impairments are then in one of 4 different areas
			- Hearing, have imapired, limited or no hearing in one or both ears
			- Vision, have impaired, limited or no vision (could include things like colour blindness or glaucoma)
			- Mobility, have impaired, limited or no movement or control of movement which could include conditions like arthritis or parkinsons that affect fine motor control
			- Cognitive, which includes anything that impacts how information is processed and includes a wide range of conditions such as dyslexia, ADHD, Autism, limited language proficiency, migraines, epilepsy and more
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Who benefits from Accessibility?
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- So again we ask, who benefits from accessibility?
			- Taking into account permanent, temporary and situation impairments
			- Considering impairments that impact hearing, vision, mobility and cognition
			- Who are we helping by making things more accessible and who are we excluding by not?
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

{/* TODO: Maybe move these later into the talk */}
	{/* <Slide>
		Captions
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Captions, transcripts, subtitles, whatever they are
			- Providing a written version of media content is a big accessibility feature
			- But it's not just people with impairments that benefit from captions
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Captions
		<audio src={InstagramMusic} data-autoplay />
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Anyone recognise this song?
			- It's over about 90% of everything on my Instagram feed
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Captions
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- It and about 3 other songs seem to make up the background music behind every video and even photo
			- I hate it, they're annoying and so I keep my volume off
			- So if a video doesn't have captions, I'm not watching it, I won't even bother to turn the volume up
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Colour Contrast
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Colour contrast, if you're not familiar with it involves making sure there's enough difference, or contrast between the background and text colours
			- But this isn't just important for people with vision impairments, when was the last time you used your phone or computer outside? We're a very sunny country, there's a lot of glare
			- Or maybe you use night mode on your device, changing the colours to be softer on your eyes in the evenings
			- If you don't have sufficient colour contrast, people in these situations can all have difficulty in reading the content on the page

		Everyone.
		<Notes slot="notes">

		Goals and Values
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- From the top down, company leadership and decision makers have the ability to make sure accessibility and inclusion are a part of the company's goals, policies and core values
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leadership, Managers, Recruiting, HR</span>

		Hiring SMEs
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Anyone involved in hiring decisions can make sure that accessibility skills are being prioritised or looked for when hiring new team members
			- That includes hiring experts in accessibility (SME being subject matter expert) or just people who have an interest are want to make a difference
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leadership, Managers, HR</span>

		Training and Upskilling
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- As well as hiring new people, we can make sure that existing team members have the skills too
			- Organising and prioritising accessibility training so everyone understands their responsibilities
			- Could be something as simple as encouraging them to come to this talk
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leadership</span>

		Understanding Regulations
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We've talked about regulations and legislation around accessibility
			- It's important that company leadership understand what these are and how they impact the company
			- As it changes, they need to be aware of what applies to them and what they need to do to ensure they're compliant, ideally staying ahead of the curve to make it easier for the teams implementing it
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leaders, Managers, Recruiting, HR</span>

		Inclusive Workplace
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We talked about the advantages of having an inclusive workplace, and it's important to make sure that policies and procedures reflect this from the very beginning when hiring new team members all the way through
			- So much of building accessible products comes from having teams with a diverse range of views and experiences, and when the workplace is inclusive it makes it much easier to build and maintain that
			- This also includes flexible working arrangements and policies that give access to anyone that wants or needs it
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners</span>

		Discussing Accessibility First
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Too many projects don't have the discussion early on, and it's harder to make changes down the track
			- When accessibility is talked about at the beginning of a project or included on a roadmap from the start it's easier to make it happen the whole way through the process
			- It's also important to make sure that accessibility is included in the definition of done, so it's not forgotten about
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners</span>

		Accessibility Testing
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- As well as including accessibility as part of the scope and definition of done
			- It's important to make sure that a plan for testing exists in the scope
			- And where possible, including accessibility user testing, by people with lived experience, for example screen reader testing by screen reader users
		</Notes>

		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners, Marketing, Content Writers</span>

		Use simple language 
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Unless absolutely necessary, don't overcomplicate it
			- Ensure content is written at a level that can easily be understood regardless of education level or language proficiency
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners, Marketing, Content Writers, Developers</span>

		Provide Text Alternatives
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Wherever information is being conveyed through images, videos, audio or other non-text formats
			- Make sure there is a text alternative being provided in the form of a transcript, caption, description or similar
			- And most importantly, make sure that text alternative can be accessed and consumed by assistive technology such as a screen reader
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Designers</span>

		Sufficient Colour Contrast
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Make sure that there's enough contrast between text and background colours so that it can be read by everyone
			- This is especially important when text is over the top of a background image or video as it can be difficult to read
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Designers</span>

		Font sizing and Spacing
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Make sure the font is a decent enough size, no hiding teeny tiny writing
			- Also ensure that there's enough spacing between items to show when they're separate
			- White space is like vegemite, you don't want to use too much or too little, but make sure there's the right amount
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Designers, Developers</span>

		Hover and Focus States
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Make sure that there's a clear hover and focus state for any clickable or interactve elements
			- This is important to make sure both design and development is involved, designers to keep it in line with everything esle and on brand, and developers to make sure that it's implemented correctly
			- This includes making sure that you're not just relying on a subtle colour change that might be missed, you can make it noticable and obvious whilst still keeping on brand
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Designers, Developers</span>

		Error Messaging
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Ensuring there is clear and understandable errors is important so that people understand what is happening and what's gone working
			- This means also making it obvious so people with vision impairments can easily find the error and is recognised and announced by screen readers or assistive technologies
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Designers, Developers</span>

		Animations and Motion
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Animations, motion and autoplaying videos can be an issue for a number of reasons, it can distract and switch focus from the content, it can trigger motion sickness in severe cases and it can trigger seizures in people with epilepsy
			- This doesn't mean you can't use animations, but it's important to make sure they're not in your face and distracting
			- There are also ways developers can check for people's preferences and disable animations if they've opted out which we'll look at in a bit
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Developers</span>

		Semantic HTML
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- One of the best things developers can do is to use correct and semantic HTML elements when building out the structure of the content
			- This includes additional functionality, context and information out of the box, is compatible everywhere and easy for assistive technologies to consume and understand
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Developers</span>

		Keyboard Navigation
		<Notes slot="notes">
		- Not everyone uses a mouse to navigate around, a lot of people find it easier to use a keyboard or other input device
		- For people with vision impairments, they can't see where the cursor is on a page, but a keyboard allows them to navigate around the functional elements
		- For people with a mobility impairment, they may not have the fine motor control needed to use a mouse or trackpad
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Developers, QA, Testing</span>
	
		Testing Procedures
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Because of the subjective nature of accessibility, there are a lot of things that can't be done automatically and we need to run manual tests to check these things
			- There are still a lot of things that can be tested automatically though, things like colour contrast, semantic HTML and in some cases keyboard navigation can be tested automatically
			- It's good to have a combination of automated and manual tests, to cover as much as possible and ensure things aren't being missed
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">QA, Testing, DevOps</span>
	
		Automated Tests
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- For the automated tests that are written, it's good to have them integrated as part of a pipeline or process so they run automatically as part of the rest of the testing suite
			- Some testing tools even allow tracking the progress being made, how many issues over time are resolved, and showcasing the improvements being made
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">QA, Testing</span>
	
		User Testing
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Although it's useful for the people building the product to ensure it's fully tested, there are some things that are best done by people with lived experience
			- Where possible, have people with impairments test what you're building, whether that's by hiring an external company or consultant or ensuring you have people on the team
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Security</span>
	
		Human Centred Security
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- When developing security policies, make sure you're remembering the people who are involved
			- When procedures are convoluted or unclear, it makes it easier for people to be succeptable to social engineering
			- People with cognitive impairments in particular are at a higher risk as they may miss signs
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Developers, Security</span>
	
		Autofill & Password Managers
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Autofill functionality and password managers are especially useful for people with impairments
			- And when these features are disabled, it makes it more likely that someone will accidentally enter confidential information to an insecure field
			- Or people may result to third party solutions to help them, which introduces additional risks of their data being compromised
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Developers, Security</span>
	
		MFA & Captchas
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Make sure that the captcha solution you're using is accessible to people using assistive technologies, a lot of them aren't or it blocks people using them
			- When using multi-factor authentication, also consider people's capabilities, some people may struggle to access and enter the code before it times out
			- When receiving an SMS code, sometimes screen readers won't recognise/announce the difference between an upper and lowercase letter, so consider whether it needs to be case sensitive

			- AA goes a step further and ensures that people with impairments can use it, although it may not be convenient. If you're working towards an accessibility standard, this is likely what you're working towards
			- Finally AAA is the highest level, is typically met by organisations who's primary user are people with impairments
			- Whatever role you are in, it's worth knowing a bit about these guidelines, at the very least that they exist, what level you have to meet and how to test against them

		<Notes slot="notes">
			- It helps to understand what people experience when using a screen reader

			- If you're feeling up to it, try closing your eyes and see if you can work things out without actually seeing the screen as well
