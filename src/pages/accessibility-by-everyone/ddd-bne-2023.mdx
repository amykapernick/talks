		- What does it mean to make things accessible, what does it mean for us
		- When we create technologies, whether software, hardware or something else

		- Given wahtever capabilities they have
		- Mean the internet, the technologies, the solutions we're creating are made for everyone and with everyone in mind

		## Why is Accessibility Important?
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="quote">
		<blockquote>
			<p>For better or worse, the people who design the touchpoints of society determine who can participate and who is left out, often unwittingly</p>
			<cite>Kat Holmes <small>Mismatch: How Inclusion Shapes Design</small></cite>
		</blockquote>
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- All of us here today are in a very important position, one to make a difference to people around us
			- We have the power to make things better for people around us
			- To decide who can participate and who is left out
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Inclusion makes us <Switch words={['more-effective', 'more innovative', 'better', 'happier']} />

		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Ignoring the fact that by building a non-accessible product we're excluding people around us
			- A study in 2018 by the Disability Council of Australia and Suncorp found that inclusive teams and workplaces where
				- 10 times more likely to be highly effective
				- 9 x innovative
				- 4 x provide excellent customer service
				- 4 x to stay at a company
				- 19 x more satisfied with their jobs
			- https://www.dca.org.au/research/benchmarks-national-diversity
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Accessibility is a human right
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We're seeing drastic changes to legislation and regulations around the accessibility and Inclusion
			- Ccuntries all over are ensuring their laws are up to date as technology becomes more intermingled with our day-to-day
			- Not a case of if, but when we're going to be legally required to make sure what we build is accessible
			- And the secret is...
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		It's easier to do it right now
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- It's easier it make changes and improvements now, as we build things
			- To include it from the very beginning, rather than trying to stick a band aid on it later
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="quote">
		<blockquote>
			<p>Every inaccessible website tells [people with an impairment] *"you aren't welcome in this world"*.</p>
			<p>If you don't know whether your website or app is accessible, it's not. Start learning.</p>
			<cite>Larene Le Gassick</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- If you don't know whether you're doing it right, you're probably not
			- It's not too late to make a change though, to start making improvements and make sure everyone using your product feels welcome.

		## Who Benefits from Accessibility?
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={Impairments} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- When we think of accessibility, we think of people with permanent impairments
			- It could be someone who was blind or deaf, someone who was in a wheelchair or missing use of a limb
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide
		type="chart" 
		caption="Global Impairments" 
		theme={frontmatter.theme}
		data={{
			type: 'pie',
			data: {
				labels: [
					'Permanent Impairments',
					'Rest of population'
				],
				datasets: [{
					label: 'Global Impairments',
					data: [15, 85],
					backgroundColor: [
						'#228b22',
						'#263773',
					],
				}]
			}
		}}
	>
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- The world bank estimates that these people, people with permanent impairments are at least 15% of the global population
			- That's over 1.2 billion people
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={Impairments} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Again these are what we refer to as permanent impairments
			- Which are just a small subset of people with impairments
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={ImpairmentTypes} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Permanent impairments are not likely to be resolved, are long term, like a missing or non functioning limb
			- There are also temporary impairments, which can't be resolved quickly but will resolve in the short to long term, for example a broken arm
			- And finally we have situational impairments which are the result of the environment alone and can be resolved by leaving it, for example holding a child or pet
			- Although not all impairments are permanent, and may not have as great an impact on a person's life, they can all be made easier by accessibility improvements we make
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide type="background" image={ImpairmentCategories} style="light">
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Impairments are then in one of 4 different areas
			- Hearing, have imapired, limited or no hearing in one or both ears
			- Vision, have impaired, limited or no vision (could include things like colour blindness or glaucoma)
			- Mobility, have impaired, limited or no movement or control of movement which could include conditions like arthritis or parkinsons that affect fine motor control
			- Cognitive, which includes anything that impacts how information is processed and includes a wide range of conditions such as dyslexia, ADHD, Autism, limited language proficiency, migraines, epilepsy and more
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Who benefits from Accessibility?
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- So again we ask, who benefits from accessibility?
			- Taking into account permanent, temporary and situation impairments
			- Considering impairments that impact hearing, vision, mobility and cognition
			- Who are we helping by making things more accessible and who are we excluding by not?
			- Let's have a look at a few different accessibility features first
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

{/* TODO: Maybe move these later into the talk */}
	<Slide>
		Captions
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Captions, transcripts, subtitles, whatever they are
			- Providing a written version of media content is a big accessibility feature
			- But it's not just people with impairments that benefit from captions
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Captions
		<audio src={InstagramMusic} data-autoplay />
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Anyone recognise this song?
			- It's over about 90% of everything on my Instagram feed
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Captions
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- It and about 3 other songs seem to make up the background music behind every video and even photo
			- I hate it, they're annoying and so I keep my volume off
			- So if a video doesn't have captions, I'm not watching it, I won't even bother to turn the volume up
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Colour Contrast
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Colour contrast, if you're not familiar with it involves making sure there's enough difference, or contrast between the background and text colours
			- But this isn't just important for people with vision impairments, when was the last time you used your phone or computer outside? We're a very sunny country, there's a lot of glare
			- Or maybe you use night mode on your device, changing the colours to be softer on your eyes in the evenings
			- If you don't have sufficient colour contrast, people in these situations can all have difficulty in reading the content on the page
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Who benefits from Accessibility?
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- 
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		Everyone.
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- When we make things accessible, everyone benefits
			- Every single one of us has at some point or will at some point benefit from an accessibility improvements
			- I mean think about the last time you avoided taking the stairs and used a lift or a ramp instead?

		<Notes slot="notes">
			- These are all situations that beenfit from accessibility improvements
			- Whether it be captions, clear design, non-complex language, thoughtful interface layout
			- Or one of many more small touches that can make billions of people's lives better and easier
			- And more importantly it can make them feel like they're being thought of and included in what we're building

			- No matter where you sit in a company
			- Or in the project or product lifecycle
			- We all play a part in ensuring that what technology is being built is accessible
			- I know this may not be everyone in the room, but if you don't fit into one of these roles, come and find me afterwards and I'd love to chat about how you can help as well

		Goals and Values
		<Notes slot="notes">

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leadership, Managers, Recruiting, HR</span>

		Hiring SMEs
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Anyone involved in hiring decisions can make sure that accessibility skills are being prioritised or looked for when hiring new team members
			- That includes hiring experts in accessibility (SME being subject matter expert) or just people who have an interest are want to make a difference
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

		<span slot="header">Company Leadership, Managers, HR</span>

		Training and Upskilling
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- As well as hiring new people, we can make sure that existing team members have the skills too
			- Organising and prioritising accessibility training so everyone understands their responsibilities
			- Could be something as simple as encouraging them to come to this talk
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leadership</span>

		Understanding Regulations
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We've talked about regulations and legislation around accessibility
			- It's important that company leadership understand what these are and how they impact the company
			- As it changes, they need to be aware of what applies to them and what they need to do to ensure they're compliant, ideally staying ahead of the curve to make it easier for the teams implementing it
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Company Leaders, Managers, Recruiting, HR</span>

		Inclusive Workplace
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- We talked about the advantages of having an inclusive workplace, and it's important to make sure that policies and procedures reflect this from the very beginning when hiring new team members all the way through
			- So much of building accessible products comes from having teams with a diverse range of views and experiences, and when the workplace is inclusive it makes it much easier to build and maintain that
			- This also includes flexible working arrangements and policies that give access to anyone that wants or needs it
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners</span>

		Discussing Accessibility First
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- Too many projects don't have the discussion early on, and it's harder to make changes down the track
			- When accessibility is talked about at the beginning of a project or included on a roadmap from the start it's easier to make it happen the whole way through the process
			- It's also important to make sure that accessibility is included in the definition of done, so it's not forgotten about
		</Notes>
	</Slide>

	<Slide>
		<span slot="header">Project Managers, Product Owners</span>

		Accessibility Testing
		<Notes slot="notes">
			- As well as including accessibility as part of the scope and definition of done
			- It's important to make sure that a plan for testing exists in the scope
			- And where possible, including accessibility user testing, by people with impairments
