						- In development we use a particular type of software called git for version control<br/>
						- It tracks any changes that we make<br/>
						- And allows us to easily back our code up online when we don't have cloud storage or a network drive<br/>
						- But unfortunately you do actually have to manually push your code to the cloud to back it up<br/>
						- And that's not something I'm great at doing<br/>
						- And one day, my computer died<br/>
						- It was slow, so I tried to turn it off and on again<br/>
						- Because that's how you fix everything<br/>
						- Except it wouldn't turn back on<br/>
						- And I lost several days worth of work<br/>
						- I told you I wasn't great at pushing my code<br/>
						- Did I mention that this was 2 hours before a client meeting<br/>
						- And I now didn't have any of the work I'd done for him?<br/>
						- Thankfully the client was also a developer<br/>
						- And understood my pain<br/>
						- But it also gave me a chance to learn a very important lesson<br/>
						- Not only am I (slightly) better at pushing my code changes so I have them backed up<br/>
						- But I set up an automatic backup that is running all the time, and backs up my entire computer (just in case)<br/>

						- Learning new skills and techniques are also important to help prepare for failure<br/>
						- When I first got a dev job, I still continued to teach myself new things in my spare time<br/>
						- Sometimes they were able to be implemented at work to make our processes better<br/>
						- Sometimes I was able to use them on a freelance project<br/>
						- And when I needed to find a new job I had skills outside of the skillset I used at the agency<br/>

							- A year later I gave it as my first conference talk<br/>
							- I flew to Melbourne and gave the closing keynote<br/>
							- I knew I might fail, but I embraced it<br/>
							- If I failed, the entire talk was a working example<br/>
							- Don't open outselves up to failure, miss opportunity to try something new<br/>
						- Didn't open up to meetup, wouldn't have given that keynote wouldn't have spoken all over the world<br/>

							- Ever have a day where something bad happens early on<br/>
							- And then something else happens<br/>
							- And then something else<br/>
							- And it snowballs<br/>
							- But if you'd taken some time at the start, at the first bad thign<br/>
							- The rest probably wouldn't have happened?<br/>
							- We often avoid failure, or owning up to one<br/>
							- But that leads to further failures, or a bigger failure down the track<br/>
							- Which could have been prevented <br/>
