						<p>
							Unsurprisingly, sometime during all this, I burnt out. But because I can be a little stubborn, or as my mum likes to put
							it...

						- Didn't take time out<br />
						- Had less going on after this, but it took me a long time to get back to normal<br />
						- Last year, working 60-70 hour weeks, volunteering and freelancings<br />
						- Wasn'tt sleeping properly, wasn't able to control my emotions, started getting dizzy and nauseous<br />
						- Recognised the signs and realised I needed to do something about it<br />
						- Inspired by recent mental health presentation night<br />
						- Went to doctor, got a week off work and a referral to see a psychologist<br />
						- Asked to come into work even though I was off sick<br />
						- Sat down with my psychologist for the first time, he asked how work was<br />
						- I laughed<br />
						- Felt happier and more relaxed than I'd started the job<br />

					<p class="title"><mark>Good</mark> Worry v <mark>Bad</mark> Worry</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						- Been a bit of a worrier<br />
						- Worry unnecessarily and catastrophise<br />
						- Without a job, enough money to last a fortnight but I wasn't worried<br />
						- Learnt the difference between useful and useless worry<br />
						- Worrying about money led to apply for jobs, seek out work and cut costs<br />
						- After that, it was no longer useful, becoming stress and not sustainable<br />
						- Really hard change to make, can't just turn it off and on<br />
						- Need to continually remind myself that worry isn't useful<br />
						- Gotten easier<br />
						- Change a good one, able to use worry to my advantage<br />
						- Gave my first conference talk, and was freaking out<br />
						- Used the worry to my advantage<br />
						- Rewrote my talk from the top down<br />
						- Organised a bunch of training sessions<br />
						- Sent the organisers a list of questions about the venue and setup<br />
						- Thought of everything that could go wrong<br />
						- Able to take my worry and use it for good not evil<br />
						- Able to give a great talk on the day<br />

					<aside class="notes">
						- Used to get to end of weekend and not have anything done<br />
						- Would berate myself for not being more productive<br />
						- Hadn't gotten anything done and now felt bad about it<br />
						- These weekends were usually after a long week<br />
						- Needed the break, took all weekend to start feeling normal<br />
						- Saw Ming speak and she told us to take time for ourselves<br />
						- So I decided to do that<br />
						- No longer felt unproductive, was letting my mind and body recharge<br />

					<aside class="notes">
						- Conscious effor to have time for myself<br />
						- Work for myself so in charge of schedule<br />
						- Includes time for myself each day<br />
						- Not productive during middle of day, so spend time outside<br />
						- Have mouse-down time each evening to wind down away from a computer<br />
						- Each night spend at least 5 minutes with a cup of tea and book<br />
						- Might be 5 minutes, might be an hour<br />
						- All time set aside for me<br />

						- Prioritising me also means prioritising time with friends<br />
						- Especially as I work from home by myself<br />
						- Catching up for coffee, meeting at the dog park<br />
						- Organising board games or movie night<br />
						- Or even trying to organise monthly dinner with friends that happens every 6 months<br />
						- Time I can spend away from work, around people<br />

					<p class="title">Boundaries</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- Always prided myself in my business that I'm always available to help<br />
						- Got more and more clients, no longer sustainable for me to do<br />
						- Spending too much time dealing with mostly non-urgen questions<br />
						- Context switching killing me<br />
						- Spending 4 hours on a task but half of that was trying to get back into the zone after being pulled away to a phone call or
						email<br />
						- Came to a head when contracting<br />
						- 3 days a week but with constant phone calls<br />
						- Saw a panel, compared employers to relationships, decided to tweak it and give it a go<br />
						- Constantly calling you, didn't like you seeing other frineds, didn't give you space? - Drew lines and implemented
						boundaries<br />
						- Gave them my schedule of when I was working on their work<br />
						- Told them I wouldn't be responding to emails immediately or answering phone calls outside of those times<br />
						- Technically didn't object to boundaries, they ignored them altogether and continued to pester me<br />
						- Even tried to get me to come into the office at 8.30pm and work in exchange for beer (no money, just beer)<br />
						- Told them it wasn't working, stood my ground and stuck to my boundaries<br />
						- Thankfull other clients have understood<br />
						- More productive and easier to manage it all<br />

						<p>About how I allocate my ducks.</p>
						<p>If you have a limited number of ducks to give om your lifetime, you need to be careful where you're spending them</p>
						<p>So say for example you can give up to 10 ducks about a particular situation</p>

						- So I started thinking about how I allocate my ducks<br />
						- Am I giving enough ducks where it counts?<br />
						- Am I giving too many ducks on something that isn't important or to someone who doesn't deserve them?<br />
						- While we don't get to choose everything in our life<br />
						- We always choose where we're giving our ducks<br />

						- If you give too many ducks on things that aren't important<br />

						- Next time you're worrying, ask yourself if it's useful?<br />
						- What can you use it for good, and at what point does it start doing harm?<br />
						- Block out time for yourself, and make sure you're prioritising you properly<br />
						- Don't let your clients, your boss or anyone else take that time from you, draw a line and set boundaries<br />
						- If someone doesn't respect those boundaries, ask yourself if the relationship is healthy and stick to your guns<br />
						- And watch your ducks, are you giving too many? Too little? Or just in the wrong place?<br />
						- Make sure you're effectively allocating your ducks<br />
