					<p class="title">Being a More Sustainable You</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>A couple of months ago I was at a conference, talking to a friend about everything I'd done during the past year. Last year I had a fulltime job and didn't have too much to worry about but I was constantly physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. I was stressed, I wasn't sleeping properly, I was struggling and I wasn't happy. And now I'm working for myself, I have so many more responsibilities and am faced with so many unknowns. I'm responsible for every piece of work I bring in, the money is sporadic and for the first time, I've just had to take a client to court as they're refusing to pay me for several weeks of work that I've already done. But despite the fact that I'm still physically exhausted, and sometimes mentally exhausted, I'm no longer emotionally exhausted. Even after a long week at work, I still have the energy left to spend time with my friends and I'm actually happy. At the end of the conversation with my friend, he excitedly told me (there may have been alcohol involved at this point) that I should share what I've learnt and give a talk about it, and he gave me the title of this talk.</p>

						<p>I didn't take time out, and although I had less going on after this, it took me a long time to get back to some form of normal.</p>
						<p>So last year, when I was working 60-70 hour weeks, volunteering and freelancing and found that I wasn't sleeping properly, wasn't able to control my emotions, had a tendency to get snappy and eventually getting dizzy and nauseous, I recognised the signs and realised I needed to do something about it. Inspired by the recent mental health presentation night Fenders had just run, I went to my doctor, took the week off work and got a referral to see a psychologist that weekend. Then towards the end of the week, I got asked to come into work even though I was off sick. That weekend I sat down with my psychologist for the first time, and when he asked me how work was I laughed. Less than 24 hours after being made redundant, I felt happier and more relaxed than I'd felt since starting the job, maybe this was a good thing.</p>

					<p class="title"><mark>Good</mark> Worry v <mark>Bad</mark> Worry</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Throughout my life, I've been a bit of a worrier. I have a tendency to worry about things unnecessarily and even to "catastrophise" things. But for some reason, when I found myself without a job and enough money to last a fortnight (maybe a month if I was lucky), I wasn't worried. It was around this time that I learnt the difference between *useful* and *useless* worry. It was ok to worry about money, because it led me to apply for jobs, seek out freelancing work and cut existing costs. But once I'd done that, the worry was becoming stress and was no longer useful. This was a really hard change to make, and I can't just turn my worry on and off, I need to continually remind myself that the worry I'm feeling isn't useful, but it's gotten much easier with practice.</p>
						<p>This change has been a really good one, because I'm able to use to worry to my advantage without it becoming unnecessary. Recently I gave my first conference talk, and I was giving the locknote so I started freaking out a bit. But instead of just worrying about what could go wrong, I used the worry to my advantage. I went back and re-wrote my talk from the top down, I organised a heap of practice sessions, some with a small group of friends and some with bigger groups in local companies, I put together a list of questions for the organisers about the venue and setup, and I thought about everything that could go wrong (some of which happened in my practice sessions) and worked out what I could do if that happened on the day. I was able to take my worry and use it for good rather than evil, and it meant that I was able to give a great talk on the day.</p>
						<p>I often used to find myself getting to the end of the weekend, and I hadn't really gotten anything done, so I'd end up berating myself for not being more productive. That then meant that not only did I not get anything done, but I felt bad about it as well. But usually when I had these weekends, it had been a very long week and it took until Sunday afternoon before I was finally starting to feel like I was recovering, I needed the chance to veg out and take a break. Then earlier this year I saw Ming Johanson speaking, and she told us to make sure we took time out for ourselves, so I decided to do that. I no longer let myself feel bad for having a quiet and "unproductive" weekend, because I was being productive, I was looking after myself and letting my mind and body recharge. </p>
						<p>I also made a conscious effort to make sure I had time for myself. I work for myself so I'm in charge of my schedule for the most part), and that now includes time for myself each day. During the middle of the day I'm not really productive, so I take time out for myself to read, go outside and enjoy the weather (when it permits). Each evening I have a "mouse down" time and spend a couple of hours winding down and doing something that for once doesn't involve a computer. And at the end of each night, I spend at least 5 minutes in bed with a cup of tea and a book. This might just be 5 minutes, it might be an hour (it might even be 3 if it's not a school night and the book is really good or almost done), but it's all time that is set aside for me.</p>
						<p>Prioritising myself also means prioritising time with my friends, especially as I work from home by myself most of the time. Whether it's catching up with a friend for coffee, meeting a friend at the dog park (which kills 2 birds with one stone), organising a board games or movie night or even trying to organise a monthly dinner with friends (which is more like quarterly, have you ever tried to coordinate between 6 busy schedules?). This is time I can spend away from work, around people, and is a chance for me to recharge.</p>

					<p class="title">Boundaries</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Now one of the things I pride myself on with my business, is that I'm always available when they need help. But as I started getting more and more clients (some of which require a fair bit of hand-holding), this was no longer something I was able to do. Not only was I spending way too much time dealing with what was mostly non-urgent questions, but the context switching was killing me. Even if I was spending 4 hours on a task, I was spending half of that time having to try and get back into the task after I was pulled away to a phone call or email.</p>
						<p>This eventually all came to a head when I was contracting for an agency and although it was only 3 days a week, I was getting phone calls, texts and emails from them all day, every day, even on days when I wasn't working for them and on days that I'd told them I wasn't available/contactable, most of which involved some form of "call me now" or "urgent". Around this time I also saw a really great panel at a meetup, and one of the panelists compared employers to relationships and so I gave it a go. If you were in a relationship with someone who was constantly calling you, didn't like you spending time with other friends and didn't give you space, does that sound like a good relationship? No, he sounds like a bit of a psycho. So I drew some lines and tried to implement boundaries. I gave them my schedule and told them the times I would be working on their work, I told them outside of those times I wouldn't be responding to emails immediately and I told them that if I wouldn't be answering my phone if I was in the middle of something. While this client didn't object to my boundaries, unfortunately they just ignored them altogether and continued to pester me all hours of the day and tried to get me to work late at night in exchange for beer so I stood firm and told them it wasn't working, I stuck to my boundaries. Thankfully all my other clients have understood and respected the boundaries I've set, and I've been able to get even more work done by no longer context switching.</p>

						<p>This year I also read *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck* and while a lot of what they talked about seemed obvious, it gave some good points. One of these was talking about how you have a limited number of fucks to give in your lifetime, so make sure you're giving them in the right places. I've even heard of teams who implement this, giving you 10 fucks to give each day. If you care about something a lot, you can give it 4 fucks, but if you don't care about something as much, you give it 1 fuck (or maybe it's not even worth a fuck at all).</p>

						<p>So I started thinking about how I allocate my fucks. Am I giving enough fucks where it counts? Am I giving too many fucks on something that isn't important or to someone who doesn't deserve them? While we don't get to choose everything in our life, we can always choose where we're giving our fucks. When I was contracting for the agency I mentioned earlier, I felt the stress start to creep back. So I thought about how many fucks they were worth, were they actually worth any of my fucks? Or was there something else I could spend the fucks on that deserved them?</p>
