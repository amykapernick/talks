						- Grew up in a small town in South East Queensland<br />
						- Always loved technology<br />
						- Small school didn't offer technology subjects<br />
						- Drawn to the rest of STEM, science and maths<br />
						- Was an expectation that I was going to go to uni<br />
						- Didn't know what I wanted to do? Do you?<br />
						- Enrolled in Engineering after high school<br />
						- Moved to Perth<br />

						- Took programming in first semester despite not wanting to do it<br />
						- Worked hard in engineering but never enjoyed it and didn't do well <br />
						- Started working in IT during second year <br />
						- Rebuilt my parents' business website for their Christmas present and realised how much I loved it<br />

					<aside class="notes">
						- Now I work from home as a freelance front end developer<br />
						- Build website for small to medium businesses, provide support and contract to agencies and companies who need an extra hand<br />
						- As a front end developer, I work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
						- Predominantly deal with the front end of the website (ie what we see) but delve a little into the back end and the servers when needed<br />
						- Also work as a developer evangelist<br />
						- Spend time in the community, talking to community groups and local companies and help running events in Perth

						- One of the things I love about my job, is I can work from wherever I can get internet, from home, the park, a cafe or while I'm on holiday or visiting my family

					<aside class="notes">
						- I also love the flexibility of my work<br />
						- I work when I'm most productive, sometimes that's 5am, sometimes 2pm (rarely though, that's nap time) and sometimes it's 3am<br />
						- During summer I work early, have 4 hours of work done by 10am and then take my dog to the beach<br />

				<section>
					<img src="../img/graduation.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- So how do you get started in web development<br />
						- The internet is a fast moving place and that means that most tertiary institutions aren't catching up fast enough for the industry<br />
						- There are a few courses, but by the time you graduation, the technology is obsolete<br />
						- The good news is there is plenty of other options available to learn more about the web<br />
						- I regularly listen to a variety of podcasts, read articles and blog posts, take online courses and attend conferences<br />
						- There's also been an increase in coding bootcamps, 3 to 6 month intensive courses to help you get started with coding and development
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="../img/woman_reading.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- Everyone learns differently and at different paces<br />
						- Some people learn best in classrooms, some from books, some listening to podcasts and some watching videos<br />
						- The great thing about getting out of high school, is you're in charge of your own learning and the best methods<br />
						- Maybe you want to check out some podcasts, read a book, go to a workshop, take an online course or coding bootcamp

				<section>
					<img src="../img/resume.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- When I first started doing web development, I was studying engineering and later I was studying commerce<br />
						- It was a great way to earn a little bit of extra money around my studies<br />
						- All my clients knew I was studying, so knew that I wouldn't be super responsive during semesters (and definitely not to contact me during exams) but I had plenty of spare time during the holidays<br />
						- It was a great way to build up some experience and add something to my resume, so when I started applying for jobs I already had experience and references from clients I'd been workign with for a couple of years

				<section>
					<img src="../img/server.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- The web is also a really big place, and the industry has many different sectors in it<br />
						- Maybe you really really like the hard core coding and would rather work on the back end<br />
						- Every site is hosted on a server, and most of them have databases all of which need to be maintained
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="../img/social.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- If coding isn't your thing, you may be interested in digital and social marketing<br />
						- This may involve providing advice or maintaining and running people's digital marketing campigns<br />
						- Across Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, making sure clients have digital presences outside of their website and maintain good quality content for their audience
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="../img/designer.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- Maybe you're more of a creative person, in which case you may be interested in being a designer<br />
						- While there's a lot more crossover between developers and designers, there are still plenty of us who lack creative flair for designing creative sites<br />
						- I can build something clean and professional, but as soon as a client starts talking about flow and energy, I bring on one of the designers I work with<br />
						- There's even a seperate branch of design opening up with User Experience and User Interface (UX and UI) designers being in hot demand as people try and make their website a nicer place for users
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="../img/analytics.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- Maybe you're more of a data person<br />
						- The internet is tracking everything we do, every site we visit, every page we view and every single thing we click<br />
						- While having that data is great, someone needs to work out what that data means and what to do with that information<br />
						- Taking the data, analysing it and translating it for people to view, and use

				<section>
					<img src="../img/dog.svg" />
					<aside class="notes">
						- The web is such a big place, and the possibilities of a career in it are endless<br />
						- There's so much work being done in a variety of different areas, like virtual reality, machine learning and AI<br />
						- The web may just be the start of your journey into tech, and something to help you discover your passion
